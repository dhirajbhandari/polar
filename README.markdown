Polar
===================

### About
Polar is an API wrapper for the Renren social network. This gem is a fork of the renren-api gem with a number of chagnes. Thanks to Lei Zhi-Qiang for the great work on the renren-api gem. This fork does a number of things differently such as using faraday under the hood and always returning domain objects.

### Useage


### Rake Tests
renren-api now uses rake and can run its tests with the default rake task ```rake from the command line.
